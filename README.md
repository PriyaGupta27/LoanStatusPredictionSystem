# LoanStatusPredictionSystem
To design and implement a Supervised Classification Machine Learning Model that will predict the loan status of the borrower if they are eligible or not. The motive is to improve the accuracy and minimize the time taken to predict. So that, only customers who are eligible based on different factors decided by banks can take the loan otherwise it will be denied. A loan application form is created as an interface so that the customerâ€™s details can be given and the bank can focus on the eligible customers predicted. The form has different fields like marital status, sex, credit history, applicant income, credit history, loan amount, loan amount term, etc.

## Models Created:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes'
- K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
- AdaBoosting
- GradientBoosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  
## Requirements:
- Web Technologies: HTML, CSS
- Programming language: Python
- Framework: Flask
- Software: VS Code 2019, Jupyter Notebook
